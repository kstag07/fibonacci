This method program tests a fibonacci method to see if the two previous value in a the fibonacci  sequence equal the tested value.  I wrote my test and then created a method where the value i would be equal to the two previous function values f(i -1) + f(i -2).  This however does not work for values less than two so you have to create an if else statement having values below two just returning themselves.
